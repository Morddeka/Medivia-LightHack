# Medivia LightHack

Hello this is a medivia light hack made by a user called Tony32 at the <b>TibiaPF Forums</b>, it is pretty simple and it only works with the OpenGl version of Medivia but it is a good template that can be worked on and a functional program at the current release of Medivia (2.0.1).
